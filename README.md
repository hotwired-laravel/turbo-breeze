## Introduction

Turbo Breeze is a fork of [Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze). It provides a minimal and simple starting point for building a Hotwired Laravel application with authentication. Styled with Tailwind, Turbo Breeze publishes authentication controllers and views to your application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs.

Turbo Breeze is powered by Blade, Tailwind, [Turbo Laravel](https://github.com/hotwired-laravel/turbo-laravel/), and [Stimulus Laravel](https://github.com/hotwired-laravel/stimulus-laravel). You may install Turbo Breeze using [Importmap Laravel](https://github.com/tonysm/importmap-laravel) and [TailwindCSS Laravel](https://github.com/tonysm/tailwindcss-laravel) for a Node-less setup, but you may also use a Vite-based setup if you prefer that.

## Official Documentation

Since Turbo Breeze is a fork of Laravel Breeze, most of the documentation of Laravel Breeze works here as well, therefore we're recommending the Breeze documentation, which can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits#laravel-breeze). For a guided tour, we recommend the [Turbo Laravel Bootcamp](https://turbo-laravel.com/guides/introduction).
